•	The current issues with your website (What are your problems? Why do you need plugins?).
WordPress Editor doesn’t give much variety when designing the website. It only offers the basic features. 
The website is not responsive as WordPress Editor doesn’t give the option.
•	What type of plugins will solve your issue and why? 
Front-end page builder plugin was used as it offers more varieties of designing features. Additional plugins can also be downloaded to be used into it.
A form plugin was also used to place a responsive form on the website so that audience can leave comments.
•	Your choice of plugin provider and why you chose one plugin provider over the others (for example: Elementor vs Divi).
Elementor was used as it allows additional features from other plugins to be downloaded online to make it easier to use.
Contact Form 7 was used as it was one of the few form plugins available to me. It also detects spam messages and filters them.
•	The high-level steps of how you implemented each plugin
Both were downloaded on azure website. Additional plugins were downloaded after research to use on top of Elementor. 
To use Elementor, I went to “edit page” and chose Elementor as a tool to edit. Features were implemented through dragging the corresponding boxes to the middle of the page.
For Contact Form 7, I had to first go to the corresponding page for it on azure website to design my form. Different themes were offered. The criteria for spam messages were also customisable to include/exclude any keywords needed. 
•	The applicable benefits realized or expected to be realized after implementing each plugin
It turned out that Elementor offer additional features with downloads of other plugins. Contact Form 7 also provides the options to filter spam messages which wasn’t expected.
